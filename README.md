This is my collection of solutions to the problems on Project Euler, a math/computer science puzzle website (https://projecteuler.net/about). They are written in a combination of C++ and python, based on which I think is best for the given problem (python primarily when the problem involves numbers bigger than the C++ literals). My goal is to solve all of the first 100 problems (not permitted to publicly post solutions for any problems after 100). Current Progress: 21/100.

Personal Favorite Solutions: 15 (Haven't seen this solution anywhere else), 27 (well optimized for the complexity)
